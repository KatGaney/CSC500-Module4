# CSC500-Module4
This repository contains the Python program for Module 4 of the CSC500 course. The program, shopping_cart.py, simulates a basic online shopping cart. It defines an ItemToPurchase class to store an item's name, price, and quantity. The program then prompts the user for two items, creates two objects of the ItemToPurchase class, and calculates the total cost of both items.
